People attacked Muslims because they were pissed off.  The nation grieved.  Sounds a lot like America after 9/11.  We then went after the source of the problem (and beyond).  The French aren't quite as bold.

That's the same year the iPhone was introduced.  I'm sure there are other factors, but I think pervasive internet and social media have certainly not helped.  I also laughed when the lady said that it's not normal for kids to say things like, \"I just wish I could go to sleep forever.\"  I've been saying that for decades.  That's like my personal mantra.  I guess I've always been one of those people who thinks about suicide and believes it's a solution.  I've always felt I'd die that way.  Like it was preordained or something.",

I know that mining is a dangerous profession, but I can't imagine the instant of fear that comes before being incinerated. Then, there families have to wait weeks for their remains to be unearthed. The whole thing is really sad.",
