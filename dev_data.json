Reno was a very visible Attorney General, more so than most.  That was sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for bad.  I give her credit for admitting that what they did in Waco was wrong, although I'm not sure what the wrong thing to do was.  But she was also corrupt like they all are at that level.  Still, she's an interesting figure in political history.  Very visible.  Didn't hurt that Will Ferrell played her on SNL.",

This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.

I think cigarettes should be considered something like alchol were you cant drink in public you cant smoke either. These children see others smoking and in there mind this is a norm and okay. I think this generation not growing up witht hat around them will set them up to make better choices in the future and be more healthy. There is a real chance to cut potential new smokers and get rid of the popularity of smoking for generations to come. I am all for this proposed ban and see no harm from imposing it.",

My brother lives in Saudi Arabia and it's a vile place full of vile people.  The more they suffer, the better.  What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.  So my brother could theoretically get into an argument with a Saudi man, but never with a women.  It's a strange, paradoxical thing, and I wonder if the Saudi women understand it before they end it.",

At some point though it becomes too much and a country like Germany can only hold so much people in it. I think what Germany needs is to overhaul their immigration laws and make a change down the middle where asylum is fair but realistic.",
