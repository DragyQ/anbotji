And unfortunately they didn't get any help from the police officers, who ran away.  What a horribly frightening experience that must have been.  On the other hand, the article is also confusing for me.  Why were the villagers so upset?  Do they earn their livings from poaching? Were they confused about what was going on?  Also, who called for the helicopter?  And how did the rangers survive if they were really confronted by all those villagers with weapons.  If the story is real then it's frightening and disturbing.  But there seems to be a lot of missing information.",

The details were sparse, but apparently a man opened fire with an assault rifle in the public space and only killed one elderly man. Say what you will, but this seems like close to an ideal resolution to a scenario like this. The article then doubled back and said the suspect was still alive despite pronouncing him dead earlier in the text. Odd.",

Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.  Welcome to it.",

I mean here is someone who was bold enough to ask for help yet no one reached out to help. I feel so bad knowing this. Depression is real and hit even the most unsuspecting people. It is so bad that she died without anyone showing her true love.",

It is scary that dictators with such control can still be in power in twenty nineteen. Putin is so evil, and I am guessing so many people were threatened to do this cover up. People should not be able to just take someone out just because they go against a governing power. If he can do this to his own people I fear what he could do to the world. He has way to much power in my belief and needs to be over thrown.",
