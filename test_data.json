It is horrible that either one of these men could have stopped this and helped but both were just cold people. How do you just go back to nromal life after muder I would fall to pieces. I think they did flee and didnt just continue on with work. They should be convicted and set to life in prison. How could you kill and burn someone and for over something so minecule like getting hit on. Karma will get back at them and I hope in a grand way. The poor family of this man it is terrible.",

I also laughed a lot at the sentence about someone wrapping bacon around the door handle of a mosque.  But I thought the portrayal of the father was very real and relatable.  I thought his quotes were also interesting and very self-reflective, recognizing what he was probably doing in his writing and why.  But the article overall was pretty vivid in allowing you to experience all aspects of the event.  People there, trying to survive.  People afterwards finding out loved ones were dead.  People angry.  People trying to keep the public safe.  All angles were shown.",

I also think we've overblown the seriousness of many of these encounters.  No, I don't think a man should grab a woman's toilet parts or breasts without some implication of consent (it doesn't have to be explicit--that's idiotic).  But the idea that one aggressive move by a guy towards a girl should ruin people's lives is stupid.  Are women not stronger than that?  Are women so fragile that one guy who catcalls at them or hugs them when they don't want it should be tarred and feathered and she has to go into perpetual mourning?  Men go after women and always will.  There are repercussions for women wanting it all.  Sorry.",

I know that they're thinking about reintroducing wolves to a lot of areas because we've killed off so many of them, deer populations are spiking and because of that ticks and lyme disease are on the rise. They're saying it might become an epidemic. Anyway, I guess my point is that some people might say that we don't need to care about wolves because they're harmful or dangerous, but it turns out that we need them. Anyway. It's sad that the wolf died, and kinda crazy that he went out via sniper.",
