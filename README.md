# Welcome to Anbotji ;)

This repository contains the code and resources for our project on personality prediction, where a machine learning model was trained to predict personality traits from textual input and integrated into a chatbot for real-time use. 

## Requirements
All necessary packages and dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
To install all required packages, run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Dataset 
The data/ folder contains the raw and processed datasets along with preprocessing scripts:
data_transform.py : Preprocesses the raw data for it to be used to training and testing. 
raw_data.csv : Raw training data
data.json : Preprocessed training data
raw_dev.csv : Raw testing data
dev_data.json : Preprocessed testing dataset
data_split.py : Splitting the dataset into training, development and test set

## Main scripts:
Model Training and Evaluation
model_prep.py: Handles model setup, training, testing, evaluation, and performance visualization. Comments are included to explain each function.
Model Info:
We use the DistilBERT pretrained model: "distilbert-base-uncased".

## Chatbot Integration
main.py: Entry point for the chatbot. It interacts with the user, collects demographic information, and conducts conversations using personality-related questions.
questions.json: Pool of personality-related questions used by the chatbot.
questions_parser.py: Randomly selects and serves questions during the chatbot interaction.
model.py: Utilizes trained model weights to predict personality traits based on user input.
helper.py: Converts model outputs into user-friendly personality insights.

## How to Use
Install dependencies using requirements.txt (see Requirements section).
Preprocess the dataset using data_transform.py if starting from raw data.
Train and evaluate the model with model_prep.py.
Run the chatbot using main.py to interact with users and provide personality predictions.
