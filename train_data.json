I understand if you don't have air conditioning it might need to be wide, but why can't we have limits so that a small body can't fall out?

It's just too sad though, because you would need to not even have a stool - at two, a kid could certainly move one of those.",

Pieces of paper?  War should be fought to win.  In World War II we leveled German cities and nuked Japan twice.  We didn't concern ourselves with preventing civilian casualties.  That would have seriously hindered us from winning the war, which should be the only point of going to war.  In the same way, the Saudis and this coalition should not concern themselves with protecting somewhat complicit Yemenis when it hinders their effort to win the conflict.  That should be the goal.  The idea of fighting wars with tweezers to prevent collateral damage is absurd, even if it means people like this father of eight die.",

A malfunction with the ride's conveyor belt is suspected to have caused the six-person raft to flip, crushing and drowning two men, aged 38 and 35, and two women, aged 42 and 32, about 2.20pm on Tuesday. Those killed include Canberra woman Kate Goodchild, 32, her brother Luke Dorsett, 35, his partner Roozi Araghi, 38, and another woman. The New Zealand Herald has named Cindy Low, 42, from Kawerau, as the fourth victim. I was really devastated by this event.",

When she was a little girls she was sexually abused by by both her parents. No need to read that again, yes, I said both her parents. They forced her to have sex with the father and the mother videotaped all of it and then they sold the footage. It makes me want to throw up. How horrible of a human being do you have to be to do that to your own child. Thankfully both parents got charged and sentenced to 20 years. Unfortunately their sentence is up. The mother was on the tv show saying how much she regrets it and that the father made her do it. I do not believe her for a second.I would rather die than hurt my kid",

I think cigarette smoke has the potential to really harm children who are growing.

It effects everyone around you when you smoke in public we dont have a choice to breathe it in so you should not have the right to do it like public drinking.",

IT's really sad to me when people are this negligent about pets and other people.  Especially vulnerable populations.  Honestly I think whatever punishment she gets, such as an animal cruelty charge, is definitely deserved and she will just have to take that as it comes.  She should have been more careful with the animal, end of story.",

They're under constant attack and can't even get basic medications that we take for granted every day here in the US. I truly hope the wars stop and these people can get some assistance rebuilding their lives and homes. More effort needs to go into donating to the charities that help in these areas.

I hope that this truly was a \"bad accident\" as described by the Sheriff, and not serious neglect or negligence or something.  But I'm not sure what the procedures are for keeping police dogs in cars, and what the likely explanation is for something like this.  The police officer presumably feels terrible, and I feel bad for him too, as long as the mistake was honest.  If it wasn't then I have no sympathy for him.  But if it was then I bet he feels horrible and partly doesn't want to show his face to the other officers anymore.",

Lina was left in that car for 38 hours.  Can you believe this?   This deeply disturbs me.  How do you forget a big police dog and not hear him for 38 hours?  Just unbelievable.   The blatant disregard society has for animals and humans is beyond my capacity to understand.   I think we are up to 82 children that have died this year and too many animals.   It's infuriating.

This is tantamount to having someone you loved murdered.  However, and it's a big however, I find it completely unacceptable for people to have to be afraid of uncontrolled dogs.  I know people who've been bit in the face by dogs.  People are killed by dogs.  Dogs are weapons, too.  No one should have to walk in a park--especially one that doesn't allow pets off leashes--and worry about being attacked. Do I think the guy overreacted by killing the dog?  Yes.  But the woman shouldn't have done what she was doing either.",

This whole movement was also based on a complete lie.  The Ferguson thing was complete horseshit.  That Brown guy attacked a cop, tried to take his gun, and was rightfully killed in the process.

Germany has always been the welcoming nation for immigrants seeking refuge from warring nations, but it seems they are just too full to really help. The biggest problem for the refugees is being able to prove their asylum case. This is especially problematic for the Nigerians and Pakistanis. Because there is no technical \"war in their country, it is very hard to prove some of their claims of violence should they have to return. That coupled with an overburdened system makes it less likely that they will be granted any asylum at all.

She was admitted into a mental hospital because she was struggling with her depression. The mental hospoital cleared her and let her go. Soon after she walked into the ocean and drowned. It is so sad that she did not get the help she needed. I hope all of our friends know that we are here for them and support them no matter whatthey are going through.",

Obviously that's a false dichotomy, and certainly Jews are allowed to dislike Trump for all sorts of reasons.  But to place this all on Trump is missing the point, in my opinion.  Trump is a symptom of any rise in anti-semitism, not the cause.  The 2016 push-back by whites and males was a long time coming, and was due to cultural changes that have absolutely nothing to do with Trump.  Trans, gays, women, minorities--all of that stuff being shoved in people's faces, aggressively, leads to push back.  Welcome to it.",

What's interesting is that the women, in their bondage, actually hold a strangely revered place in society.  I'm not sure what an analogy would be, perhaps the elderly.  On one hand, it's true they have many limitations on their lives.  On the other, because of that they're treated as almost untouchable.

How horrible is that? When will we wake up and do something about global warming before it is too late? Before we know it, the polar bears will be extinct. So sad.",
